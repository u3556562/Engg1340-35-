HKU ENGG1340 Project

In a grocery shop, if the waiting time of buying grocery at the cashier is too long, the customers will choose to leave without buying anything. This project aims to build a cash register system. It can help to reduce the waiting time and make less people leave the store without spending in order to maximize the profit.
